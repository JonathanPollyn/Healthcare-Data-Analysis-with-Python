# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-with-Python

## Overview

The repository for healthcare data analysis using Python for healthcare. The purpose of this repository is to assist professionals and students who are learning how to use Python for data analysis, with a particular emphasis on datasets related to healthcare. In this course, you will be guided through practical, real-world applications in the healthcare business, regardless of whether you are new to Python or looking to enhance your data analytic skills. 

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:
- Understand the basics of Python programming and its application in data analysis.
- Learn how to manipulate and analyze healthcare datasets using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries.
- Gain proficiency in data visualization to explore trends and patterns in healthcare data.
- Apply statistical methods and machine learning techniques to healthcare data.
- Develop and present data-driven insights that can support decision-making in healthcare.

## Repository Structure

- **/notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks containing lectures, exercises, and project templates.
- **/data/**: Example healthcare datasets used throughout the course. (Note: Real-world datasets may require appropriate permissions for use.)
- **/scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization tasks.
- **/projects/**: Final project examples and student submissions.
- **/resources/**: Additional resources include readings, valuable links, and reference materials.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JonathanPollyn/healthcare-data-analysis-python.git
    ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    All codes are written in Google Colab 

3. **Explore the Notebooks**:
    Start with the notebooks in the `/notebooks/` directory to follow along with the course materials.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Python Basics**: Variables, data types, control structures, and functions.
- **Data Manipulation**: Using Pandas to clean, transform, and analyze data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful charts and plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
